; 2023.02.02    V1.1.6.009  =   rearanged code in exclude bounding lines function, correct a problem in RAM disassembling, the opcodes were not displayed, added comments
; 2023.01.31    V1.1.5.008  =   error correction in the RAM version, the W-command was not working
; 2023.01.30    V1.1.4.008  =   add comments to the B-command

; 2023.01.14    V1.1.4.007  =   work on ram under rom function ;error correction, rearange code and commands, add floppy commands, add more comments

In the RAM under ROM function was a problem, it was not possible any more, to save the ROM content from $A000 to $FFFF.
With the new updated, this is corrected.

The SMON-RAM-PLUS-version now get back the "Y" command to move the SMON to different memory location. 

The command to change the memory location $01 is now available with the P-command. Examble: P 33 will write the value $33 into the memory location $01. The original P-command to change the printer address is removed.

Additional disc-cammands are added to both RAM version:
- P@ shows the error channel from the floppy
- P$ shows the directory
- P"cmd" sends a floppy command

The idea for this additional commands are based on a SMON-version provided to me by rh70,
which is also a member from FORUM64.

; 2022.09.09    V1.1.3.005  =   add a switch to hide the bounding line after 'brk','rts' and 'jmp', add some comments, re arrange the code
; 2022.09.08    V1.1.3.004  =   error correction in the SAVE command in the RAM version
; 2022.09.04    V1.1.2.004  =   error correction in "comma" function in RAM version
; 2022.09.03    V1.1.1.004  =   add the show ram under rom function, add more comments, re arrange code

    I have added a new function to the source code,
    with this function it is possible to show the RAM under the ROM in the area from $A000 to $FFFF

    To compile it you should uncomment the RAM or RAM1 in the source code.

        RAM is the PLUS version with the extended function.
        RAM1 is the ILOC version with the extended function.

    The Trace commands are not implemented now, and therefore removed.
    The Y-command to move SMON is removed.
    To change the address $01 you can use the Y-command
    For example: Y37 switch to normal status, Y34 switch to RAM
